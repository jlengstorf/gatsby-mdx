## What Can I Do

With gatsby-mdx, you can:

* Render Markdown content using custom React components
* Write entire pages in markdown and JSX by placing a file in src/pages
* Use regular markdown code blocks when authoring, but display them as interactive playgrounds when rendering
* Use React Components as a more powerful version of shortcodes
* Use [gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/?=gatsby-remark-) to optimize images using an advanced "blur-up" technique popularized by Medium
