The fastest way to get started with Gatsby+MDX is to use the [MDX
starter](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic). This
allows you to write .mdx files in `src/pages` to create new pages on
your site. 

# ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby MDX site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the MDX starter.

    ```sh
    npx gatsby new my-mdx-starter https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-mdx-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link:
    `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to
    experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this
    tool in the [Gatsby
    tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql). 

    Open the `my-mdx-starter` directory in your code editor of choice
    and edit `src/pages/index.mdx`. Save your changes and the browser
    will update in real time!
