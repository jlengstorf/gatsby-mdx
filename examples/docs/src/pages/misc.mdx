Things I have to document


## Adding any const export to an MDX file includes it in the GraphQL schema


```
export const author = {
	name: "chris"
}
```

```graphql
graphql`{
  exports {
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}`

# frontmatter for pages in src/pages is automatically added to the pageContext

```
props.pageContext.frontmatter.title
```
