title: "Using Gatsby Remark Images"
---

Gatsby-MDX is compatible with all of the [gatsby-remark
plugins](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/?=gatsby-remark),
including
[gatsby-remark-images](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/?=gatsby-remark).

To enable gatsby-remark-images, you first need to install the relevant
image plugins:

```shell
yarn add gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-remark-images
```

If you don't have `gatsby-source-filesystem` installed, also install that.

Then configure the plugins. `gatsby-source-filesystem` needs to be
pointed at wherever you have your images on disk,
`gatsby-remark-images` needs to be a sub-plugin of `gatsby-mdx`, and
`gatsby-plugin-sharp` can be included on it's own.

```js
plugins:[
  `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-mdx`,
    options: {
      gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
      {
        resolve: "gatsby-remark-images",
        options: {
          maxWidth: 1035,
          sizeByPixelDensity: true
        }
      }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-source-filesystem",
    options: {
      path: `${__dirname}/src/pages`
    }
  },
]
```

Then enjoy using images in your MDX files!
