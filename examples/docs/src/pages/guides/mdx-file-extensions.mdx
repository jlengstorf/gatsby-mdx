title: "MDX File Extensions"
---

By default, only files with the `.mdx` file extension are treated as
MDX when using the `gatsby-source-filesystem`. To use `.md` or other
file extensions, you can define an array of file extensions in the
`gatsby-mdx` section of your `gatsby-config.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-mdx`,
      options: {
        extensions: [".mdx", ".md"]
      }
    }
  ]
};
```
