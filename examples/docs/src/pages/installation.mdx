If this is your first time here, check out the [quick start](/getting-started), otherwise read on to find out how to add Gatsby+MDX to your project.

# Add to Existing Gatsby Site

Alternatively, you can add Gatsby+MDX to an existing site. We recommend that you play around with the basic starter first, to get a feel for what MDX is and how it works.

To use `gatsby-mdx` with a pre-existing gatsby site install
`gatsby-mdx` as well as MDX itself which comes in two packages
(`@mdx-js/mdx` and `@mdx-js/tag`)

```bash
npm install gatsby-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/tag
```

then add `gatsby-mdx` to your `gatsby-config.js` in the `plugins` section.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [`gatsby-mdx`]
};
```
